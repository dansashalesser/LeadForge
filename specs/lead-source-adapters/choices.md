# Choices Ledger — lead-source-adapters

Decisions made where the spec was silent. Appended per implementation pass.
Verdicts: `sound` (any reasonable implementer would agree) / `unsound` (needs rework) /
`needs-user` (a preference the agent does not own).

## Pass 1 — 2026-10-05 (task 1.1)

Not logged: uv/hatchling, `>=` floors + `uv.lock`, and offline `tldextract` were settled by
the user at the Phase -1 gate. Test location, pytest/ruff/mypy config, and placeholder
wording were named implementer's choices.

### Root `leadforge` CLI is owned by the ingestion slice
- **Verdict:** needs-user
- **Spec said:** `leadforge ingest` entrypoint (design stack table); nothing on who owns the root `leadforge` app once other stages (qualification, personalization) need subcommands
- **Chose:** `[project.scripts] leadforge = "leadforge.lead_ingestion.cli:app"` — the slice's Typer app *is* the product CLI
- **Alternatives:** a thin root app at `src/leadforge/cli.py` mounting each slice's sub-app (`app.add_typer`) — but that is a cross-slice module, which D1/CLAUDE.md discourage until a second stage exists
- **Provisional:** reversible — change one line in `pyproject.toml` and move `ingest` under a root app when stage two lands; no command name changes for users
- **Evidence:** `pyproject.toml` `[project.scripts]`; subagent report "CLI layout"

### Slice tests and the static guard ship inside the wheel
- **Verdict:** unsound (low severity)
- **Spec said:** tests live in the slice (D1); nothing on packaging them
- **Chose:** `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel] packages = ["src/leadforge"]` — includes `lead_ingestion/tests/`; `structure_guard.py` is a runtime module whose only consumer is a test
- **Alternatives:** exclude `**/tests/**` from the wheel; keep the guard under `tests/`
- **Fix next pass:** add a hatch wheel `exclude` for `**/tests`; consider moving the guard into `tests/`
- **Evidence:** `pyproject.toml:36-37`, `src/leadforge/lead_ingestion/structure_guard.py`

### Raw schemas are private by package: everything under `lead_ingestion.adapters`
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Spec said:** guard "no module outside this slice may import a provider raw schema" (tasks.md:33); no location for raw schemas (design names components, not paths)
- **Chose:** `RAW_SCHEMA_PACKAGE = "leadforge.lead_ingestion.adapters"`; whole subpackage (adapter classes included) off-limits outside the slice. Binds tasks 12–15 to put raw models there
- **Alternatives:** a `raw_schemas` module per adapter, or marker base class detected by name — both weaker for an AST import check
- **Evidence:** `structure_guard.py:13`; subagent report "Raw schema location"

### Guard scans only `src/`
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Spec said:** "outside this slice"; silent on non-`src` code (scripts, `tests/integration`)
- **Chose:** `src_root.rglob("*.py")` minus the slice
- **Alternatives:** scan repo root — would flag integration tests that legitimately touch raw fixtures
- **Evidence:** `structure_guard.py:27-34`

### Dependency floors not given by the design
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Spec said:** floors for httpx/tenacity/alembic/typer only
- **Chose:** pydantic>=2, sqlalchemy>=2, structlog>=24, pyyaml>=6, python-dotenv>=1, tldextract>=5; dev mypy>=1.13, pytest>=8.3, pytest-asyncio>=0.25, respx>=0.22, ruff>=0.8; exact versions in `uv.lock`
- **Evidence:** `pyproject.toml`

### Dev interpreter pinned to 3.12 via `.python-version`
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Spec said:** Python 3.12+
- **Chose:** pin 3.12 so uv stops defaulting to 3.13; `requires-python` stays `>=3.12`
- **Evidence:** `.python-version`; subagent report

### Files touched outside the slice
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Spec said:** single-folder blast radius (D1)
- **Chose:** empty `src/leadforge/__init__.py` (packaging needs it) and cache/venv entries appended to `.gitignore`
- **Evidence:** subagent file list

Evidence: partial — the refactor and production-readiness agents were not spawned (the
subagent has no Agent tool). Serena diagnostics run by the parent: only `reportMissingImports`
for third-party packages (Pyright not pointed at `.venv`); mypy strict inside the venv is clean.

## Pass 2 — 2026-10-05 (task 2.1)

Gates overridden by the user ("proceed anyway") with the directive to test extensively and build
real Employment↔Company Signal linking. Not logged: test layout, seeded `random.Random` loops
instead of `hypothesis` (not a dependency), `Any`-typed aliases in tests for deliberately
ill-typed input, compliance flags defaulting to `False` (OR-merge belongs to the merge task).

### At most one current Employment per Lead (hard rejection)
- **Verdict:** needs-user
- **Spec said:** "historical employments persist alongside the current one" (24.2); nothing on concurrent jobs or on what happens when a provider reports two current roles
- **Chose:** `CanonicalLead` raises if more than one Employment has `is_current is True`
- **Alternatives:** allow several current Employments; keep the Lead and flag/demote extras at normalization; pick one deterministically
- **Provisional:** reversible — delete one validator clause; no stored data exists yet. Risk to watch: real providers do emit two "current" roles, and this turns a usable Lead into a normalization failure
- **Evidence:** `models.py:164-165`, tests in `test_canonical_entities.py`

### Company Signal identity key `company_id` (new field)
- **Verdict:** needs-user
- **Spec said:** share one Company Signal across Leads (24.3); the merge design keys employment matching on registrable domain (design Key 3), not on an opaque id
- **Chose:** added `CompanySignal.company_id: NonBlank`, used by `share_company_signals` for dedup and conflict detection and by the in-Lead conflict check
- **Alternatives:** key on the registrable domain set; key on `(name, domains)`; content equality only
- **Provisional:** reversible while only 2.1 depends on it, but later tasks (merge, normalization) will bind to it. Decide before the merge task: who assigns `company_id`, and how does it relate to domain-based matching?
- **Evidence:** `models.py` `CompanySignal`, `share_company_signals`; `ConflictingCompanySignalError` in `errors.py`

### Email typed as `str` with a hand-written check, not `EmailStr`
- **Verdict:** needs-user
- **Spec said:** design Domain section declares `email: EmailStr | None`; the design's own risk note says `EmailStr` rejects some real provider addresses and failures must be named, not coerced
- **Chose:** plain `str` plus `_check_email`, stored verbatim, because `email-validator` is not installed and no dependency was added
- **Alternatives:** add `email-validator` and use `EmailStr` as designed
- **Provisional:** reversible — swap the annotation and add the dependency; a deviation from the approved design, so confirm
- **Evidence:** `models.py:76-87`

### `Employment.company` holds the `CompanySignal` object, not an id
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Spec said:** an Employment names a Company Signal; shared across Leads rather than copied (1.7, 24.2, 24.3)
- **Chose:** object reference, giving real shared identity (`is`); Pydantic revalidation left off so instances are not copied
- **Evidence:** `models.py` `Employment`; identity tests

### Frozen, `extra="forbid"`, tuple collections, hashable entities
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Spec said:** reject undeclared fields, frozen against mutation (1.4, 24.1); design names the config
- **Chose:** shared `_Entity` base with `ConfigDict(extra="forbid", frozen=True)`
- **Evidence:** `models.py:49-50`

### Person identity is any of email, LinkedIn URL, full name (non-blank)
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Spec said:** a record with no person identity is never a Lead (1.5)
- **Chose:** at least one non-blank identity attribute; `email_status` defaults to `UNKNOWN`, and any other status without an email is rejected; `linkedin_url` is `HttpUrl`
- **Evidence:** `models.py:145-160`

### Duplicate Employment rejected; same company with different stints allowed
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Spec said:** silent
- **Chose:** exact-duplicate Employment raises; a conflicting `CompanySignal` under one `company_id` inside a Lead raises
- **Evidence:** `models.py:161-175`

### `is_current: bool | None` and optional non-blank `title`
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Spec said:** title and current flag "where the provider supplies them" (24.2)
- **Chose:** `None` means unknown, never coerced to past
- **Evidence:** `models.py:120-128`

### Company Signal shape and Signal ranges
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Spec said:** fields open
- **Chose:** needs a name or at least one domain; domains unique, no whitespace, stored verbatim; `Signal.strength` finite float in [0, 1]; `TechSignal` and `IntentSignal` are non-interchangeable subclasses
- **Evidence:** `models.py:61-118`

### `share_company_signals` semantics
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Spec said:** share one Company Signal across Leads (24.3)
- **Chose:** equal copies collapse to the first-seen instance; conflicting content raises; idempotent and non-mutating
- **Evidence:** `models.py:177-201`

### Deferred to later tasks
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Chose:** `contributing_sources`, `provenance` on the Lead, and `UntrustedText` left out; `full_name` is a non-blank `str` for now (2.2 and normalization own them)

Evidence: partial — `spec-refactor-agent` and `validate-production-agent` were not run by the
subagent (no Agent tool). Parent re-ran pytest: 196 passed. Commit 74a1532 is local and unpushed;
`tasks.md` shows 2.1 `[x]` but is uncommitted (specs/ is not committed by harness rule).

## Task 2.1 — user decisions on the three `needs-user` choices

### Several current Employments are allowed and flagged
- **Decision (user):** a Lead may hold several current Employments; extras are flagged and weighed when judging lead quality, not rejected.
- **Done:** the "at most one current" validator is removed. `CanonicalLead.current_employments` and `has_multiple_current_employments` are derived properties (not serialized fields). The scoring task consumes the flag.

### `company_id` is one canonical id assigned by this layer
- **Decision (user):** one company id unified across all providers; a provider's own id is normalized onto it.
- **Done:** `company_id` stays the Company Signal identity; `CompanySignal.provider_ids` (tuple of `ProviderCompanyId(source, id)`, one per source) records each provider's native id. Providers never supply `company_id`.
- **Open for the merge task:** the rule that assigns `company_id`. Design D7 makes company identity a domain set under the pinned PSL, so the merge task should derive `company_id` deterministically from that domain set, and match on registrable domain, never on `company_id` alone.

### Email uses `EmailStr`
- **Decision (user):** add `email-validator` and follow the design.
- **Done:** `email-validator>=2.3.0` added; the hand-written check is removed. `EmailStr` lowercases the domain and keeps the local part, so the earlier "stored verbatim" behavior changed. Surrounding whitespace is rejected, not stripped, to keep the no-silent-coercion rule.

### Notes for the merge task (from the 2.1 follow-up self-review)
- `provider_ids` and `domains` compare by tuple order, so one company with the same ids in a different order reads as a conflict. The merge task should canonicalise the order (for example, sort) before comparing.
- `share_company_signals` raises when two signals share a `company_id` but carry different `provider_ids`; it does not union them. The merge task must unify Company Signals across providers before calling it.

## Task 2.2 — FieldProvenance (pass audit)

### Confidence invariants by Confidence Origin
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Spec said:** record Field Confidence verbatim with its scale; origin none records no fabricated number (1.2, 1.8)
- **Chose:** `none` requires `confidence`, `confidence_raw`, `confidence_scale` all None (even 0.0 rejected); `provider_stated` requires raw and scale, normalized `confidence` optional; `heuristic` requires a `confidence` number and forbids raw and scale
- **Evidence:** `models.py:102`, `tests/test_provenance.py`
- **Note:** the `heuristic` rule is the least obvious; revisit if a heuristic ever needs to cite a scale.

### Invariant violations raise pydantic `ValidationError`, no taxonomy error
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Chose:** consistent with 2.1 entities; adapter layer wraps into `NormalizationError` later, since it holds the source name and raw path

### `confidence` reuses the [0, 1] `Strength` type
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Chose:** finite 0.0-1.0, matching design.md's normalized-for-comparison scale

### `fetched_at` must be timezone-aware
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Chose:** naive datetimes rejected (`AwareDatetime`); merge recency ordering needs an unambiguous instant. Reversible.

### Blank strings, verbatim raw, enum placement, deferred fields
- **Verdict:** sound
- **Chose:** `NonBlank` on path/source/raw/scale fields; `confidence_raw` a verbatim string; `DataMode` in models.py per design.md; `untrusted`, `CanonicalLead.provenance`, `contributing_sources` left to 2.3 and the normalizer/merge tasks; `superseded` defaults False

Evidence: partial — `spec-refactor-agent` and `validate-production-agent` not run by the subagent (no Agent tool). Parent re-ran pytest: 227 passed. Commit ce27828 is local and unpushed; `tasks.md` shows 2.2 `[x]` but is uncommitted (specs/ not committed by harness rule).
